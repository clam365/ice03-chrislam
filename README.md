# ICE 03: The Other One/Creative Coding
Members: Just me!

Contributions: For the creative coding, used D3.js to create 2D volcano contour lines. No Necessary things, the contour is just shown.

volcano.json originated from https://observablehq.com/@d3/volcano-contours/2

base starter code used from https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/density2d_contour.html (edited to use json files and new format)
